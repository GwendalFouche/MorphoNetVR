# MorphoNetVR

MorphoNetVR is a software made at Inria Centre Rennes Bretagne Atlantique research lab, based on MorphoNet (https://morphonet.org/). As MorphoNet, this software is made for the exploration of 3D and 3D temporal segmented datasets, but also uses a VR interface and explores new interactive visualization methods adapted to such interface.

The built demo is coming soon.

People involved in the development of this application:
 - Gwendal FOUCHÃ‰
 - Emmanuel FAURE (emmanuel.faure@lirmm.fr) (also involved in the original MorphoNet software)
 - Ferran ARGELAGUET (ferran.argelaguet@inria.fr)
 - Charles KERVRANN (charles.kervrann@inria.fr)
